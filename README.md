# Genetic Drift Model

This is a small personal model developed during my first year in Biomedical Engineering. It is an interactive model of the genetic drift implemented in netlogo. Two versions of the same model can be found: 2D and 3D. They both are equal but simply changing how the content is presented, choosing 2 or 3 dimensions as the user prefers.

The user can change the parameters to represent several environments affecting differently to the population
